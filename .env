## See the "Settings" section in README.md for more details

## Set this to true if you're using a load balancer, or set it to false if you're using separate IPs for each service.
## If you're using monolithic (the default), leave this set to true
USE_GENERIC_CACHE=true

## IP addresses that the lancache monolithic instance is reachable on
## Specify one or more IPs, space separated - these will be used when resolving DNS hostnames through lancachenet-dns. Multiple IPs can improve cache priming performance for some services (e.g. Steam)
## Note: This setting only affects DNS, monolithic and sniproxy will still bind to all IPs by default
LANCACHE_IP=10.0.39.1

## IP address on the host that the DNS server should bind to
DNS_BIND_IP=10.0.39.1

## IP address for metrics exporters to bind to
## Leave blank to bind to DNS_BIND_IP
METRIC_BIND_IP=

## DNS Resolution for forwarded DNS lookups
UPSTREAM_DNS=8.8.8.8

## Storage path for the cached data
## Note that by default, this will be a folder relative to the docker-compose.yml file
CACHE_ROOT=./lancache

## Change this to customise the maximum size of the disk cache (default 2000g).
## If you have more storage, you'll likely want to increase this.
## The cache server will prune content on a least-recently-used basis if it
## starts approaching this limit.
CACHE_DISK_SIZE=2000g

## Sets the minimum free disk space that must be kept at all times.
## When the available free space drops below the set amount for any reason,
## the cache server will begin pruning content to free up space.
## Prevents accidentally running out of disk space if CACHE_DISK_SIZE is set too high.
MIN_FREE_DISK=10g

## Change this to allow sufficient index memory for the nginx cache manager (default 500m)
## We recommend 250m of index memory per 1TB of CACHE_DISK_SIZE
CACHE_INDEX_SIZE=500m

## Change this to limit the maximum age of cached content (default 3650d)
CACHE_MAX_AGE=3650d

## Set the timezone for the docker containers, useful for correct timestamps on logs (default Europe/London)
## Formatted as tz database names. Example: Europe/Oslo or America/Los_Angeles
TZ=Europe/London
