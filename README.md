# Docker Compose for a full-stack lancache.

This docker-compose is meant as an example for running our lancache stack, It will run out of the box with minimal changes to the .env file for your local IP address.

### More information
The LanCache docker-stack is generated automatically from the data over at [UKLans](https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains). All services that are listed in the UKLans repository are available and supported inside this docker-compose.
